# 3. Define the variables needed by your virtual machine Char in the general env of 
#   your terminal, so that you can run the docker ps command without errors. 
#   You have to fix all four environment variables with one command, 
#   and you are not allowed to use your shellâ€™s builtin to set these variables by hand.

eval $(docker-machine env Char)


# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# note: this is how you connect to the docker-machine
#       to disconnect, you run " eval $(docker-machine env -u) "
#       to see if you actaully connect docker through your terminal, run: " docker ps "
#       -- write the command in the terminal to test if this work.
