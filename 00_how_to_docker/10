#   What are volume in docker?
#   
#   A data volume is a specially designated directory within one or more containers that
#   bypasses Docker’s storage driver and interacts directly with the host file system. 
#   Data volumes provide several useful features for persistent or shared data:

#   1. Volumes are initialized when a container is created. If the container’s base 
#   image contains data at the specified mount point, that existing data is copied into 
#   the new volume upon volume initialization.
#   2. Data volumes can be shared and reused among containers.
#   3. Changes to a data volume are made directly to the host filesystem 
#   (vs. going through the storage driver)
#   4. Changes to a data volume will not be included when you update an image.
#   5. Data volumes persist even if the container itself is deleted.
#   6. Data volumes are designed to persist data, independent of the container’s 
#   lifecycle. Docker therefore never automatically deletes volumes when you remove 
#   a container, nor will it "garbage collect" volumes that are no longer referenced 
#   by a container
