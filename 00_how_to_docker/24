# 
# RabbitMQ is an implementation of AMQP, the emerging standard for high performance enterprise 
#   messaging. The RabbitMQ server is a robust and scalable implementation of an AMQP broker.

# To deploy an application image when Docker Engine is in swarm mode, you create a service.

# RabbitMQ is a message-queueing software called a message broker or queue manager. 
#   Simply said; It is a software where queues can be defined, applications may connect 
#   to the queue and transfer a message onto it.
